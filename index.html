                        <h2>Bad Temper.</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father
                        gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost
                        his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.<br/>
                        The first day, the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence.
                        Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger,
                        the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down.
                        He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive
                        those nails into the fence.<br/>
                        Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all.
                        He told his father about it and the father suggested that the
                        boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold
                        his temper. The days passed and the boy was finally able to
                        tell his father that all the nails were gone.<br/>
                        The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.
                        He said, "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes
                        in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say
                        things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can
                        put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many
                        times you say I'm sorry. The wound is still there."

                            <h2>The Bonded Donkey</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>This Short Story The Bonded Donkey is quite interesting
                            to all the people. Enjoy reading this story.<br/>
                            In a small village, there lived a potter. He had a donkey.
                            Everyday his donkey would carry soil from the field to his
                            house. Since the field was quite far off, the potter would
                            rest under a tree midway, tying his donkey nearby.<br/>
                            One day, the potter forgot to take the rope with which he
                            tied the donkey everyday. When he reached the tree, he thought,
                            “How do I tie this donkey today? He might run away if I sleep.
                            “The potter decided to tie down holding the donkey’s ears so
                            that the donkey would not run away.<br>
                            But this way neither the donkey was comfortable nor the potter
                            was able to take rest. A saint, who happened to be passing by,
                            saw the potter holding on to the donkey’s ears. Then the saint
                            wanted to know what the problem of the potter was. When the
                            potter told the saint what the problem was, the wise saint said,
                            “Take the donkey to the place where you tie him everyday.
                            Pretend to tie him using an imaginary rope. I assure you
                            he won’t run away." The potter did what the saint had said.
                        </p>
